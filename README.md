# auto-speech-or-paragraph-generator
here we created a auto speech or paragraph generator using Markov's chain (NLP) in python 

HEY EVERYONE

I have used markov's chain to create a speech or paragraph generator. Unlike the usual implementation that is done using group of 4 alphabets I have simply seperated each word and used it as a whole.
This simple change brings a huge differene in the output we get. The produced output is much more logical and more human-like.

It stil lacks the flow and logical sentence compared to normal human language and one might find the speech funny. but trust this gets better by increasing the length of the the input test speech

A simple code if you are aware of the basics jo just read it and you will know.

Hope you enjoy playing around it!!
